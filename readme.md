# Fun Macro Econ Theory

Macroeconomic theory learning notes, for fun.

- For cheat sheet, see folder `cheat sheet`. There are two versions inside:
  - `cheat_sheet_Macro.tex` and `cheat_sheet_Marco.pdf`: full length version, a lot of things going on, as detailed as a cheat sheet can be, to the point that it can barely be called a sheet anymore. It could be used as a learning guide, at least that's how I see it.
  - `cheat_sheet_Marco_short.tex` and `cheat_sheet_Marco_short.pdf`: the shorter version, more like a sheet, but still way too long. Only containing the important things, or at least those that I deem important.

I have put some serious effort into these things, but I think the cheat sheets themselves are not that helpful, it's more about the process of compiling them. Macro is not my field but I have indeed learned a lot, modelling, coding, storytelling, etc. I think it's definitely worth spending some time to get a good grip of the basics, and that's the purpose of all these shenanigans ;)
